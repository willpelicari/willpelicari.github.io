My first web development experience was as a child at the age of 13 when I was looking for something to do in a time when internet access was limited, but the desire to learn how to create websites already existed. I learned to use Microsoft Frontpage and Dreamweaver and started developing my first PokÃ©mon website called Blaziken Domain. Despite all the amateurism, this project allowed me to take my first steps in PHP, understand important concepts like 'Don't repeat yourself,' and gave me the certainty that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: develop. The site ended up having a small success during the time it was online, reaching 500 daily visits, according to the visitor counters of the time. By clicking on the Blaziken icon, you can be redirected to the Wayback Machine to see my 2004 page (or what's left of it). The site is in Portuguese, but in the 'Team' section, you can still read my name! :)"
